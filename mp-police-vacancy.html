<h1>Why is the CTET Exam Called the First Step To Get a Government Teaching Job? </h1>


<div>
<p>You must have a CTET certificate before you can apply for any government teaching position. As a result, the first step is to complete the CTET Application Form. The CTET exam is held once a year by the CBSE. It used to be organised twice before. A teacher's ability is the primary goal of the CTET, which stands for Central Teachers Eligibility Test.</p>
<p>You can apply for a government-teaching position if you pass this exam. To put it simply, CTET certifications help to ensure that government-subsidized schools have qualified teachers. As this exam is a little difficult, you should begin preparing for it as soon as possible if you plan on taking it. Take advantage of online resources such as the CTET Mock Exam, Previous Year's Questions and Answers, Study Guides, and more to better prepare for the exam itself.</p>
<p>Anyone considering teaching as a profession should take this exam to ensure a bright future as a government educator. Once you pass this test, you'll be eligible to apply for teaching positions with various government agencies whenever vacancies arise.<br />Why CTET Certification Is Essential &ndash;<br />Having a CTET Certificate is a requirement for working as a teacher in a government school. If you have this certificate, you can apply for government jobs on various websites. The majority of you may be wondering why you need a CTET certification. Let go of your preconceived notions, because we're about to delve into the details.</p>
<p>If you want to work for the federal government, you must have a CTET certificate as a minimum requirement. A CTET credential will be yours if you successfully complete and pass this exam. To put it simply, this certificate will be a tremendous asset to your professional profile.<br />The CTET certificate grants you access to all central government platforms, so you can easily apply for any job you want.. Most qualified teachers are unable to apply because they lack this certification. However, if you have a CTET certificate, you won't have to second guess yourself. Central Government teaching jobs, such as ERDO, KVS and NVS, can be applied for by anyone.<br />It doesn't matter how much education or experience you have, or how dedicated you are to your work. For government jobs, you must have a CTET certificate. When you are denied the opportunity to apply for this government-teaching position, it will be extremely disappointing.

Since your profile appears promising in comparison to others, you will be the first candidate shortlisted.<br />Which Marks Are Required &ndash;</p>
<p>Most of you are probably wondering how many marks you need to get this incredible teaching certificate. Only if you achieve a grade of 60 percent or higher will you be granted this eligibility certificate. SC/ST/OBC/Disabled candidates may be eligible for special considerations. You're wrong if you think this exam is going to be easy. It's a difficult test, so you'll want to practise as much as possible before taking it.</p>
<p>If you're in the General Category, you'll need a Qualifying Percentage of at least 60%. This means you'd need 90 out of a possible 150 points to pass.<br />If you're OBC, SC, or ST, your Qualifying Percentage must be at least 55 percent. This means that you must obtain at least 82 points out of a possible 150 points.<br />Authenticity of the CTET Certificate</p>
<p>A CTET certificate has a seven-year shelf life. Candidates for government teaching positions must have this certificate in order to move forward. The best part is that you can retake this exam as many times as you want. There is no limit on the number of times you can take this exam. If they are not satisfied with their results, CTET-qualified candidates can retake the exam as many times as they want.</p>
