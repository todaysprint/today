<h1>The Best Way to Revise Your UPSC Notes Before Examination </h1>


<div>
<p>At the same time, the month leading up to the exam can be both challenging and frustrating. However, those who remain calm and focused during the final months before the exam are the ones who succeed in the UPSC CSE. Revision is essential for the UPSC exam because of the wide range of topics covered. If you ask any UPSC topper, they will tell you that revision is the key to their success; they have gone over their notes multiple times before the exam.<br />Having your own notes is the best thing that could ever happen to you. For the months leading up to the UPSC examination, your handwritten notes will serve as your bible. It is much easier to quickly review material from the notes before the exam days and they also contain the most relevant content. Using your own handwritten notes helped you ace UPSC's first step. Now put those notes to good use. The best ways to revise from notes are detailed in this article.<br />What's the best way to revise your UPSC notes?<br />The best way to do this is to draw a diagram. Having gone through your notes, you will realise that you are a normal human with a normal ability to retain information. They have a normal-sized brain, just like everyone else. As a result, creating multiple flowcharts to connect various topics becomes extremely important. Connecting different historical events through flowcharts is a great way to revise your NCERT Modern India History Notes. It will help you retain more information and improve your essay writing skills in the mains.<br />Consider Previous Questions and Quizzes. In addition to simply reviewing a topic, you should also attempt quizzes based on the material you've studied. In the same vein, try solving previous year's questions based on topics you've studied from your NCERT notes for the UPSC. As you revise, you'll see if your handwritten notes contain adequate information on the relevant topics. Regularly administering quizzes will serve as a timely reminder of any material you may be forgetting.<br />Techniques for Frequently Revising: The less information you retain about the topics you've revised, the more time elapses between revision sessions. In other words, even if you revise something today, one month from now you will only recall 50-60 percent of what you studied. After that, you'll have to put in at least seventy percent as much time as you did before. It is possible to retain 90% of what you learned if you revisit the topic a week later and spend as little as half an hour revising it. As a result, designate a day of the week solely for revision.<br />Static subjects should take precedence: Static topics are more common in History, Politics, Geography, and Economics than other subjects. Because static questions are the only ones that can be predicted in the UPSC exam, you should do well on them. Make a plan for how much time you'll spend on each topic so that you can go back and revise at will. Revival is always preferable to starting a new project.<br />Think outside the box when revising. Revising from the same notebook gets boring and tiresome after a certain amount of time. Yes, this is a common occurrence among candidates. You can make revision goals more interesting by including things like recording your oratory on a specific topic or closing your book and telling a friend the storey of everything you learned about a topic. Alternatively, you could simply draw a mind map in your head. Use your imagination to keep your brain active, and you'll be able to revise your notes more effectively.</p>
