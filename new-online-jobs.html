<p>The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is one of India's most esteemed commissions. It is a national level exam conducted by UPSC to recruit candidates for various civil service positions in the Indian Administrative Service, the Indian Police Service, the Indian Foreign Service, and so on. Preliminary, main, and interview rounds make up the UPSC CSE exam selection process.</p>
<p>The first and most important phase of the exam, UPSC Prelims, is not easy to pass. The best way to pass the UPSC Prelims Exam is to pull up your socks and make a game plan. Aside from that, they should have a thorough understanding of the UPSC selection process before beginning their preparations. The exam strategy and a specific study plan that must be followed throughout the entire preparation process will be helped by familiarity with the entire recruitment process. Since so many people want to join the Indian Civil Services, we've written this article to explain the various stages of the UPSC selection process.</p>

The prelims exam will include two sections, each worth 200 points: General Studies I and General Studies II (CSAT). Each paper has a two-hour time limit.</p>
<p>UPSC Prelims Result: The UPSC Prelims Result will be released shortly after the prelims exam is completed. In order to progress to the next stage, only candidates who score above or equal the UPSC cut-off will be allowed to do so.</p>
<p>Mains Admit Card: Only those candidates who passed the preliminary exam will be able to download their admit card from UPSC's website. Applicants must log in with the correct credentials to access the hall ticket and bring it along with the required documents to the designated testing location.</p>
<p>All eligible candidates must appear for the UPSC Mains exam at their allotted location and time after downloading the UPSC Mains Admit Card. a total of 9 descriptive papers will be required for this course. Two of the nine papers will be of a qualifying nature. The qualifying paper is the General English &amp; Language Paper, and there are four general studies papers, an essay, and two optional papers to choose from in the course of study.</p>
<p>A few days after the main exam, the UPSC will announce the results of the mains. To be eligible for the next round of UPSC Recruitment, candidates must score above or equal the UPSC cut-off.</p>
<p>Candidates who have passed the main exam will be contacted for an interview by the UPSC after the results are announced. A total of 275 points are awarded for the Interview/Personality Test. Candidates' performance in the Mains and Interview rounds will determine the final merit list.</p>
