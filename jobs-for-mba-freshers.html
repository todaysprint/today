<h1>4 Reasons NCERT Books Are Important For the UPSC Preparation </h1>


<div>
<p>It's safe to assume that CBSE students are familiar with the value of NCERT (National Council for Educational Research and Training) textbooks in their education. To prepare for the board exams, students need to read these books. But that's not all; they're also helpful for the UPSC exam. Yes! NCERT textbooks play a critical role in preparing for the UPSC exam, as you may have guessed.</p>
<p>As a result, we recommend that students who are unsure of which books to study for the UPSC first consult the NCERT books. We've outlined some of the reasons for this below to help you better understand.</p>
<p><br />What are the advantages of studying from NCERT textbooks for the UPSC?<br />Many of the questions on the preliminary exam are based on the same material.<br />Many students are unaware that 35 to 40 questions from the NCERT textbook appear in the UPSC preliminaries. In addition, a small number of NCERT questions make it into the mains exam. Instead of spending a lot of money on study materials, turn to the NCERT textbooks for classes 11 and 12.</p>
<p>Many academic experts recommend starting the UPSC preparation in the same way. NCERT books should be a part of your study plan, whether you're taking classes or studying on your own. The same textbook is used to teach all of the fundamental concepts and knowledge. Whether you're preparing for math, English, or any other subject, start with the NCERT books.</p>
<p>2. Don't get lost in the ocean's vast expanse.<br />Coaching materials can be confusing for students at times. It's because they offer a collection of different topics for students to study. Because of the in-depth explanation, aspirants may become disoriented as to which topic they should focus on first and how much information they should retain about each one. NCERT books, on the other hand, are the most effective resources for speeding up exam preparation.</p>
<p>NCERT books alone aren't enough, though. Aspirants must first challenge themselves and grasp the fundamentals of the field. As a result, we advise them to take notes while consulting NCERT texts. Sticky notes or short notes on paper should be used, and they should be reviewed frequently. Candidates will not deviate from their preparation path in this way.</p>
<p>3. Preparation time is reduced.<br />On the other hand, coaching institutes can take days or even weeks to complete a single subject. Using the NCERT books, a single topic will take a full day to complete. It's because NCERT textbooks stick to the facts and don't present you with stories. Downloading NCERT books and notes online is the best option if you don't own them.</p>
<p>One or two charge a nominal fee, but the majority of them are available for free. When it comes to studying for the forthcoming UPSC exam, NCERT textbooks are your best bet. With these study aids, you'll be ready in no time at all. However, the format you prefer (print or digital) is a factor.</p>
<p>Information that can be trusted<br />Aspirants for the UPSC are sometimes perplexed by typos and spelling errors in other study materials. NCERT books, on the other hand, provide students with accurate information. After all, knowing the right answers to the test's questions is critical to getting good grades. As a result of their creation by industry leaders and brightest minds, these books are regarded as reliable references.</p>
