<p>The state and category-specific merit lists will be based on the total number of points scored in the online written test. Sectional qualifying marks will not be used in this year's competition. Up to three times (approximately) the number of vacancies in each State and Category will be shortlisted for Screening, if a candidate scores the minimum aggregate qualifying score, as determined by the Bank.</p>
<p>In Objective Tests, incorrect answers will not be penalised. For Online Written exams, sectional marks will not be kept.</p>
<p>Screening for SBI CBO 2021<br />Those who perform well enough in the Online Written Test will be contacted for the Screening process. The Bank's Screening Committee will determine whether or not the applicants meet the experience requirements for eligibility. With the help of their current/previous employers, the Committee will compare each candidate's job profile to the job profile of a Scale-I Generalist Officer at the State Bank of India.</p>
<p>Interview with SBI's CBO 2021<br />An interview will be scheduled for those candidates who have passed the screening process. Fifty marks will be awarded in the SBI CBO 2021 Interview. In order to be considered for final selection, candidates must achieve minimum qualifying marks in the interview. The Bank will set the minimum qualifying marks.</p>
<p>Candidates who qualify for an interview under the 'OBC' category must submit an OBC certificate with the 'Non-Creamy layer' clause included. To be eligible for an interview under the General category, a candidate must submit an OBC 'Non-Creamy Layer' certificate, even though they have registered themselves as OBC. According to DoPT guidelines, candidates who meet the EWS eligibility criteria must submit an EWS certificate based on gross annual income for the financial year 2020-21. According to DoPT guidelines, candidates who register as EWS but do not submit an EWS certificate issued based on gross annual income for the financial year 2020-21 will not be considered for an interview under the General category.</p>
<p>Final Merit List for SBI CBO 2021<br />Candidates must pass both the online written test and the interview in order to be considered for the position. Final merit lists will be compiled based on a combination of the scores obtained in the Interview and the Online Written Test (both the Objective and Descriptive Tests). In order to arrive at the final merit list, candidates' scores in the Online Written Test and Interview will be weighted 75:25. Following the aggregation of the converted marks from the online written test and interview, a state- and category-specific merit list is generated. Top-ranked candidates from the Final Merit List will be selected for consideration (State-wise and Category-wise).</p>
