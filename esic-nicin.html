<h1>Common Mistakes To Avoid While Preparing For UPSC IAS Exam </h1>


<div>
<p>In the UPSC CSAT, you risk losing your chance to become a Civil Service Officer if you make mistakes. This is one of India's most prestigious and competitive exams, the UPSC IAS exam They don't learn from their mistakes and keep repeating them, which is one of the reasons why they fail the exam. In order to get the best score possible, aspirants must avoid these mistakes. The preliminaries for the civil service examination draw approximately 7 lakh students, but only a small number of them are successful due to the high level of competition. To do well on the exam, candidates should take advantage of the best UPSC CSAT Online Coaching available and devote enough time to self-study. The candidates' mistakes have been addressed in this article, and we have provided a concrete solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ignoring the Course Outline<br />One of the most critical aspects of the selection process is the UPSC Syllabus. Because the syllabus is so lengthy, candidates often skip it in order to save time and instead rely on their coaching's study materials. There's no denying the value of the study guides provided by the tutors. However, candidates must understand the significance of the syllabus and the topics it covers. You can save time by sticking to the IAS syllabus and avoiding topics that are never tested. As a result, it is recommended that candidates familiarise themselves with the UPSC syllabus prior to beginning their exam preparation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Making Excessive Use of UPSC IAS Exam Preparation Materials<br />No doubt UPSC Syllabus is very vast and lengthy but that doesn&rsquo;t imply that you have to follow too many UPSC IAS Books in the preparation. If you read too many books on the same subject, you may get bogged down in details and become frustrated. For each section, candidates should consult one or two books. The reviews of other students and toppers can be found online before you buy books for your preparation.</p>
<p>Mock tests should be avoided at all costs</p>
<p>Candidates frequently err by failing to practise mock exams and previous year's papers before taking the real thing. As it is well known, the UPSC CSAT exam is extremely difficult to pass because of its highly competitive nature. It is essential to stay ahead of the pack in order to ace the exam. You should keep in mind that the UPSC Prelims exam has negative marking for incorrect answers. As a result, you should take regular practise tests and learn all the shortcuts and tricks necessary to attempt all of the answers accurately within the allotted time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Snubbing the NCERT books.<br />Candidates often make the error of skipping NCERT while studying. It's possible to get a solid grasp of each topic with NCERT and then refer to more advanced textbooks for core preparation. Because NCERTs are freely available online, this is a good thing. Students who use NCERT books can build a strong conceptual grasp on all topics by learning everything from the ground up in a straightforward manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having no interest in current events<br />While studying, many aspirants neglect to keep up with current events or use the wrong resources. Candidates should be aware that the UPSC Question Paper contains a large number of current affairs questions. To prepare for the current events section, candidates should read newspapers, magazines, and news channels. For better preparation, you can access daily and monthly current affairs on a variety of online platforms and YouTube channels. To prepare for the exam, read the newspaper for at least an hour each day and jot down any relevant information. You should also attempt at least two current affairs quizzes each day.</p>
