<h1>State Specific Career Opportunities for Freshers </h1>


<div>
<p>If you're looking for a job that pays well and provides stability and security, you've probably already read a lot about the SSC exams, UPSC exams, and bank exams that are popular. However, the competition for these exams is extremely ferocious. We'll discuss a few state-specific opportunities for freshers and working professionals in this post. For people who don't want to relocate for work or work close to where they grew up, this is a must-read.</p>
<p>We'll go over a few of the most popular state-level exams, but you can use this as a guide for what your state will offer you in terms of educational opportunities. Look up your state's equivalent exams and apply for positions that best match your qualifications, aspirations and skills.</p>
<p><br />Supreme Court of India, Delhi<br />To select civil judges, Delhi's High Court conducts the Delhi Judicial Services recruitment exam once every year. These exams can be taken by any Indian lawyer or advocate who is currently licenced to practise law in India. Over INR 1,77,000 in salary is possible, with a starting salary of just over INR 56,000. In order to pass this hiring process, you have a maximum of six chances. Similar exams and recruitment procedures are used in a number of other states. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>RAS (Rajasthan Administrative Services) examination<br />The examination for the Punjab civil service<br />The Judicial Services Examination in Himachal Pradesh<br />second state-wide competitive examination for the administrative services in Himachal Pradesh Judicial Services in Rajasthan<br />The Rajasthan High Court is holding a recruitment drive to find qualified individuals to fill the position of Civil Judge (CJ) in the state. Even now, this process is being carried out offline.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Rajasthan High Court hires for more than 1500 vacancies each year, including (JJA) Jr. Judicial Assistants, (JA) Jr. Assistants, and clerks for both the High Court and the state's district courts. Aspirants for the three aforementioned positions must also have a bachelor's degree from a reputable university in order to be considered.</p>
<p>TNPSC 3rd<br />Deputy Collector and District Registrar in Group 1, Typist, Jr. Asst., Grade 3 Executive Officer in Group 4, and Forest Department Assistant, Treasury/Accounts Department Accountants, Assistant Inspector, etc. in Group 2 are just some of the positions that the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) recruits for on a yearly basis. It's possible to get a job in Group 2 of the TNPSC without having to go through an interview. Aspirations, abilities, salary expectations, and personal comfort level with interview processes all play a role in which group a candidate applies to.</p>
<p>Since there are only about 50-150 open positions across all job profiles in Group 1, these positions are the most sought after and the most competitive. Group 1 positions pay anywhere from INR 50,000 to over INR 1,75,000 per month. The TNPSC's Groups 2 and 3 have a combined total of over 5000 openings.</p>
<p>Each state has its own Public Service Commission (PSC) that assists the State Government in recruiting qualified individuals for various roles across functions, departments, levels, etc. More than a million jobs are available to those who pass State PSC exams. Keep an eye on the official website of your state's PSC and set up/turn on desktop notifications for any relevant opportunities that may come your way (if possible).</p>
<p>Recruitment for HPPSC's HPAS<br />Every year, the Himachal Pradesh Public Service Commission conducts the Himachal Pradesh Administrative Services recruitment process to select candidates for six vacancies.</p>
<p>&ndash; The tehsildar is referred to here.</p>
<p>Himachal Pradesh Administrative Service in Himachal Pradesh Asst. Registrar Block DO (Development Officer) District Controller Police Services<br />You can take this offline exam in any of the ten cities across the state where it is being offered. If you have a master's or doctoral degree from an accredited university or college, you are eligible to take the HPPSC HPAS exam. To be eligible for this, there is no minimum percentage that a candidate must have achieved in their undergraduate studies. Despite the low number of openings, the high salary makes it worthwhile to take the exam.</p>
<p>Depending on the position you're applying for, salaries can range from INR 9,000 to INR 35,000.</p>
<p>Bihar Provincial Civil Services recruitment, better known as the Bihar PCS exam, Manipur Public Service Commission, and Uttar Pradesh Provincial Civil Services recruitment are some of the other popular but less well-known state-specific exams.</p>
<p>Just type "State Government Exams for Freshers" into Google or visit the official website of your state's PSC to see if there are any current openings.</p>
