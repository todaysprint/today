<h1>Which topic to prepare for Banking Awareness in SBI PO Exam </h1>


<div>
<p>Please, aspirants, Competitive examinations for banking sector jobs are held by SBI (State Bank of India) every year. SBI PO (Probationary Officer) exams are a fantastic opportunity for those who want to work in the SBI/government sector. For this year's exam, candidates must be familiar with the exam's format and the SBI's recent changes to it. Preliminary questions are based on quantitative aptitude, reasoning ability, and general English, and the pattern is straightforward. Computer aptitude and general awareness are also included in the mains exam pattern. The widest range of questions can be asked about general awareness among these topics.</p>
<p>It's critical for candidates to do well in this section because a high score here will boost your overall score. It is critical to the selection process and takes up the least amount of time during the exam. SBI PO prelims general awareness topics will be discussed in this article.</p>
<p>Following is a breakdown of the importance given to general knowledge questions in bank exams:</p>

<p><br />Consciousness at Large</p>
<p>Candidates should aim for the highest possible score in General Awareness in order to gain a significant advantage over their competition. As a result, they must thoroughly prepare their General Awareness. We've broken this up into a few sections, so you can focus on each one at your own pace.</p>
<p>The Latest Happenings (CA)</p>
<p>The section on general knowledge is the most weighted. There are about 40 to 45 percent current events questions on the exam, and this is a major factor in the final score. Reading is the first step in preparing for current events. Be sure to read widely and from various perspectives. Candidates should devote at least one hour each day to keeping up with the latest events in the world of current events. They should take notes to the point and spend a lot of time rereading the same material. This is due to the fact that the more times you read the same thing from different perspectives, the more deeply it sinks into your subconscious. As of the exam's date, Current Affair should have studied for at least the last 100 days. Candidates can simply consult a newspaper for this information. Newspapers disseminate up-to-date information from all over the world. You can read any newspaper you want, but The Hindu is a good option for staying current.</p>
<p>Having a basic understanding of banking and finance</p>
<p>It's a big concern for many people applying for the job. Fortunately, this segment is a cinch to put together. What's the first thing you should do before anything else? Check the RBI (Reserve Bank of India). After you've finished this, read Arihant's Banking Awareness. Financial Terms and Concepts, Bank Mergers, Financial Organizations, Schemes and Policies, People and Banks in News, Financial Markets, Monetary Policy, Indian Economy (Union Budget and Economic Survey), World Economy, Committees &amp; Recommendations, Agreements &amp; MoUs (Memorandum of Understanding), Summits and Pacts, Business Deals and Acquisitions are all covered in the SBI PO examination. If you come across a piece of news that falls into one of these categories, be sure to read it thoroughly.</p>
<p>GK in place</p>
<p>This section, on the other hand, is open-ended. However, one should still prepare for it because it's better to be overprepared than underprepared. You should concentrate on the Indian Static GK first. Information on dams and rivers; national parks and sanctuaries; nuclear power plants; capitals and currencies of countries; headquarters of major organisations; and many more topics are included in the general information. You may also be asked for the capitals and currencies of countries our Prime Minister or President has recently visited or countries whose heads have visited India, so you should be familiar with them. To help you remember the countries in this section, group them together based on whether they share a currency or not. Make a "points to remember" chart for each of India's states to help you review quickly. Keep in mind the past. Divide the history of a country into two periods: the period before and the period following independence. By plotting the events on a chronological timeline, you can remember them better. Go over the most important articles, amendments, bills, and laws in the Indian Constitution. Aside from that, compile a list of notable individuals in sports, literature, and the arts.</p>
<p>In this regard, you can clearly see that the scope of the general awareness syllabus is quite extensive. To succeed in this situation, you must get to work right away. Everything mentioned above must be thoroughly understood. If you don't have access to a newspaper, there are a number of useful apps you can install on your phone to help you improve your skills. Practice your general knowledge by taking as many quizzes and mock exams as you can. In addition, the following publications may be helpful to you:</p>
