Group C stenographer salaries range from INR 9,300 to INR 35,000 per month, while Group D stenographer salaries range from INR 5,000 to INR 20,000 per month. As of this writing, there are approximately 1,500 open positions. As compared to Grade C vacancies, there are significantly more or even twice as many Grade D positions available. A typing/skills test is also part of the application process.</p>
<p>Over 5,000 to 6,000 vacancies are filled each year by the Delhi police recruitment cell of the SSC, which conducts the recruitment process. Job satisfaction, social status, generous allowances, and additional perks such as the and Central Government Employees Group Insurance Scheme (CGEGIS) and National Pension Scheme (NPS) all contribute to the job's appeal. The salary ranges from INR 21,000 to INR 69,000, but these factors aren't the only ones that make the job exciting.</p>
<p>In addition to serving as police officers, constables can also rise to become ACPs and DYSPs (Deputy Superintendent of Police). You may be turned off by the selection process's physical fitness requirements. Prior to submitting an application, please keep that in mind.</p>
