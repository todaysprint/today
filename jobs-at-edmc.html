<p><br />The selection process for SBI POs<br />Each round is equally important, and thus qualifying for the next round is necessary until the final selection process is completed.</p>
<p>SBI PO Preliminary.<br />The SBI PO Prelims Exam measures a candidate's general aptitude in the initial stages of the recruitment process.<br />It is a one-hour online objective test for the SBI PO Preliminary Exam.<br />There are three sections: English Language, Reasoning Ability and Quantitative Aptitude.<br />There will be no sectional cut-offs for the SBI PO Prelims Exams.<br />The bank, on the other hand, will offset a general reduction based on the categories of applicants.<br />Ten times the number of vacancies (approximately) in each category will be shortlisted for the Main Examination based on the merits listed above.</p>
<p><br />In the second phase, SBI PO Mains.<br />In order to sit for the SBI PO Main Exam, candidates must pass the preliminary exam.<br />Each of the SBI PO Mains Exam sections has an objective and descriptive component.<br />Logical Reasoning &amp; Computers, English Language, Quantitative Aptitude, and Economy/General/Banking Awareness are all part of the SBI PO Mains Exam.<br />The 50-point descriptive test follows immediately after the objective test.<br />Each category's final score in the Main Exam will be used to compile a final merit list.<br />Sections will not be cut off.<br />It is expected that three times the number of openings in each category will be filled by candidates who have met or exceeded the minimum aggregate qualifying score. Those candidates will be shortlisted for the Group Exercise and Interview.<br />the SBI PO group interview and exercises (stage three)<br />After a lengthy selection process, the process has now come to an end.

<p>Preparation Tips for the SBI PO 2021 Exam<br />Tips for writing an SBI PO, since this is the first step:</p>
<p>No significant changes were made to the exam patterns for last year's Prelims phase of various bank exams, as can be seen in Table 1.<br />However, there was no new pattern-based question in the IBPS prelims tests at any given time.<br />Only their length and degree of difficulty had changed. To be more precise, you need to put in more effort and work harder.<br />It's time to get down to the nitty-gritty.<br />SBI PO prelims is a speed test, and you must attempt at least 65-70 questions in the exam.<br />Accuracy is the third pillar of a successful project.<br />Why If you can't correctly answer 60 questions on the SBI PO Preliminary exam, there's no point in trying.</p>
<p>You can't afford to lose any of your correctly answered questions if you don't attempt them accurately.<br />As a general rule, you must correctly answer a large number of questions to qualify for the preliminary exam.<br />This pattern change means that you'll need to devise a strategy for answering all of the questions in each section within the time limit (20 minutes per section).<br />You must answer at least 20 questions in English in order to meet the most recent pattern modification. To achieve this, it would be helpful if you now approached the questions in an intelligent manner.<br />Because the English component can be completed in less than 20 minutes, you can move on to RC and read the text even after completing the rest of this section.</p>
