<h1>5 Reasons why SSC CGL cut-off increases every year </h1>


<div>
<p>In India, there is no such thing as an easy competitive exam. Exams like the UPSC, NDA, and SSC are difficult to pass. Only a few candidates succeed, but many dreams are shattered as a result of the same exam. Each year, tens of thousands of hopefuls take the exam in an attempt to land one of the many open positions. The cut-off, in addition to the level of competition, is an additional source of anxiety for many aspirants. As the SSC CGL cut-off rises year after year, the dreams of many students are shattered. But why does it keep increasing each year? In this post, we'll look at some of the factors that contribute to the SSC CGL's higher cut-off scores.</p>
<p>SSC CGL factors to blame or increased cutoff criteria</p>
<p>More people running for office</p>
<p>Every year, more and more people want to run for office. Millions of people applied in 2020, but only 1,25,279 were selected for the Tier 1 phase of the SSC CGL examination, compared to 1,50,396 in 2019. There will be a smaller pool of candidates to choose from if more are chosen, and vice versa. It's also a legal requirement that Staff Selection Commission (SSC) must keep up the exam's standards if more people apply for it. As a result, the commission is selective in who it hires to work for it.</p>
<p>fewer vacancies, but more applicants</p>
<p>There is no denying that there is a fierce competition amongst the applicants. Aspirants for the SSC CGL are in high demand. The commission, on the other hand, only keeps the most capable and talented members of its ranks. As a side note, the number of SSC CGL vacancies has been reduced significantly. Only 8582 vacancies were announced by the apex commission in 2019 in comparison to 11,271 vacancies in 2018, according to the data. As a result of fewer openings, the SSC must raise the bar for applicants.</p>
<p>The exam has a normalisation factor.</p>
<p>To put it another way, normalisation is the process of balancing the test scores of candidates who took the test in more than one shift. Candidates are more likely to receive an additional 40 to 50 points because of normalisation. In some cases, candidates in Tier 1 of the SSC CGL receive 100% marks. SSC has to maintain exam quality and raise cut-offs to select the most qualified candidates for the next step.</p>
<p>The level of difficulty</p>
<p>Every exam has the general rule that the cut-off is lower if the difficulty level is higher. However, the cut-off will be higher if the difficulty is lowered. Aptitude and reasoning are among the more difficult sections of the test to pass with a perfect score. However, SSC does not always set the most difficult questions. The difficulty level of the paper decreases over time, resulting in an increase in the cut-off. Candidates must be able to deal with the exam's difficulty level in addition to waiting for SSC CGL Exam dates in order to succeed.</p>
<p>There are fewer opportunities for employment in the private sector.</p>
<p>The safety and security of a government job attracts many applicants. Human Resources and Medical Insurance (HRA) and other benefits are provided. In contrast, in the private sector, there is a tremendous amount of work to be done and intense competition. The private employer, on the other hand, may not be satisfied with many of them. To get a government job, they choose exams like SSC CGL. The commission, on the other hand, is unable to accommodate all of the department's candidates. There are high cut-off points in exams as a result.</p>
