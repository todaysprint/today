<h1>Effective tips to get a successful result in the TNPSC examination </h1>


<div>
<p>Several candidates aspire to pass the PSC (Public Service Commission) examination. Candidates from all over the country and from all over the world apply for this examination every year. TNPSC is getting the same amount of attention as the state-level PSC exam (Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission). In 2019, around 13.59 million candidates applied for the TNPSC Group 4 level exam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least 83.4% of those who applied to take the test did so, according to various sources. Few of them achieved the desired result and passed the exam. It's because they don't know how to properly plan and schedule their study time. For them, we've provided this post with a few useful pointers that help the candidate do well.</p>
<p><br />How to Pass the TNPSC Group 4 Exam?<br />In addition to English, focus on regional languages.<br />Your years of experience and fluency in the English language are undeniable. Nonetheless, this is a state-level PSC examination. Regional languages like Pothu Tamil should be studied by aspirants, too. Keep in mind that the General knowledge portion of the mark is the same as the Pothu Tamil and English section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do your best in the language portion of the test. If you can get a 95/100, you'll have a better chance of getting into college, according to some academic experts. There are a variety of online resources for self-study. If you aren't satisfied with your self-preparation, tutoring platforms have online mentors who can help you with your exam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Pay attention to previous trends.<br />From 2012 to 2016 (excluding 2015), the number of current events questions in the exam increased. The language section, on the other hand, had an annual enrollment of 100 students. History counted two years with 18 General Knowledge questions, and two years with 16 questions. Since the format and number of questions in each section are constantly changing, candidates should keep an eye on these trends.</p>
<p>TNPSC Group 4 Previous Year Papers should be consulted by candidates in order to gain a better understanding of the subject matter. Candidates can get a better idea of how to approach the preparation process by looking at the previous year's papers. Once you've analysed previous trends, make sure to stick to the revised exam format and get to work on your studies.</p>
<p>3. Don't ignore the question you expect to get<br />The expected questions for the TNPSC change from year to year, but as previously mentioned, there will be 100 questions on language. As a result, every year, there would be 12-24 questions on current events, 2&ndash;4 questions on physics, and 10&ndash;14 questions on economics. In order to get more ideas, we recommend that candidates look to the internet for inspiration.</p>
<p>The current affairs section is important to begin with, however. As a result of the fact that this portion of the exam changes every year. So, to improve your chances of passing the exam, familiarise yourself with the questions that are likely to be asked. Candidates do not have to spend a lot of money on coaching for current affairs. It's also simple to prepare on your own. Keep up with the latest trends by reading newspaper and magazine articles, as well as watching the news.</p>
<p>4. No new chapters can be read before the exam.<br />Finally, candidates who have a tendency to cram for exams should refrain from studying for additional modules in the days leading up to the test. It's because there's a greater chance of losing the new information. Instead, they should go over the information they've learned a number of times.</p>
