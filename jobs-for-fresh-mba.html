<h1>BANKING EXAMS PREPARATION: TIPS TO BOOST YOUR QUANTITATIVE APTITUDE SCORE </h1>


<div>
<p>Only a few candidates out of tens of thousands of applicants are able to pass the Banking Exams each year.</p>
<p>To a large extent, this is due to the examination hall's ticking clock and the low level of accuracy in the Maths section.</p>
<p>In the Quantitative Aptitude Section, candidates have only 20 minutes to solve 35 questions that require a high degree of accuracy and speed.</p>
<p>In the Banking Exam, the Maths Section, most candidates fall short of the required speed and accuracy.</p>
<p>A low score in the Maths Section lowers their overall score, making it more difficult for them to be selected.</p>
<p>Even so, this fear of Banking Maths can be conquered simply by following a practical strategy of practise and study.</p>
<p>Tips on How to Become a Master of Math Exams for the banking industry<br />Series of numbers: The Missing Number Series is one of the most straightforward and high-scoring topics on the Banking Exams. Missing Number Series Questions can be mastered in a matter of practise sessions. Wrong Number Series Questions, on the other hand, are sometimes asked instead of Missing Number Series Questions. However, if you've practised thoroughly, you'll be able to answer these questions in no time at all. To pass the Banking Examination, all you need to do is practise and learn a few simple types of Number Series relations. Consider learning arithmetic progressions to help you with complex number series questions and arithmetic questions as well.<br />Quadratic equations are the easiest questions to answer after the number series questions. Quadratic Equation problems can be extremely difficult and time-consuming if you don't practise. When it comes to quadratic equations, you can easily solve a problem within 10-20 seconds if you practise hard enough. You'll be able to complete Quadratic Equation Questions much faster if you're familiar with Mathematical Tables.<br />Simplification Questions, when used in conjunction with the Number System and Quadratic Equation, are the perfect score-booster questions that require less time to solve and can be attempted with high accuracy. How long it takes you to solve the Simplification questions doesn't matter; what matters is how long it takes you. If you spend too much time on simplification questions, it will hurt your overall score and you may end up skipping arithmetic questions. Therefore, it is important to practise thoroughly in order to reach a high level of speed.<br />Data Interpretation Questions (DIs) are what make or break your Math score on the banking exams. As a result of the difficulty and length of DI questions in banking exams, it is essential to have a fast calculation speed. For the exam, a few DIs based on Arithmetic Chapters, such as Time and Distance, Percentage etc. require a solid conceptual understanding of these chapters. ' As a result, you should begin practising your DIs as early as possible in your preparation period. It will not only boost your self-confidence, but it will also sharpen your arithmetic skills. A score of 25-27 is still a good score even if you attempt all of the DIs, Number Series, Quadratic Equation, and Simplification Questions.<br />In the Banking Exam, arithmetic questions are the most difficult to answer correctly. In order to avoid wasting time, you should always attempt arithmetic questions at the end. If you don't solve arithmetic problems, you won't get 30+ in the Maths Sections. The majority of questions in arithmetic are based on Profit &amp; Loss, Time &amp; Distance, Permutation and Combination &amp; Probability, and Ratio Proportion.<br />The Quantitative Aptitude section of the Banking Examination can be highly rewarding for candidates who devote time and effort to their preparation. The following are some pointers to help you improve your quantitative score on the Banking Examination.</p>
