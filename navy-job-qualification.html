<h1>Indian Cricketers Who Also have Good Government Jobs </h1>


<div>
<p>Indian cricketers are revered as gods because they consistently perform at the highest levels and make their country proud. Some of them, however, deserve special attention because they are not only excellent athletes but also high-ranking government officials. The big reveal will be made at the end!</p>
<p>Ajit Wadekar, an Indian cricketer who also holds a high-ranking position in the government:</p>
<p>Before becoming Team India's coach and captain, Ajit Wadekar was a flamboyant and aggressive left-handed batsman. An interesting tidbit about Ajit Wadekar is that he actually passed the State Bank of India's Bank PO exam in order to work there (SBI). The former Indian cricket captain went on to work for SBI after his career ended, eventually rising to the position of Chief General Manager.</p>
<p>The likes of Bishan Singh Bedi and Gundappa Viswanath were not the only cricketers to land high-paying banking positions. IBPS PO Vacancy List has been updated by many of these banks, which gives us the opportunity to work for these esteemed organisations for the rest of our lives.</p>
<p>It's Joginder Sharma:</p>
<p>Who hasn't heard of this former Haryana pacer? In the first T20 World Cup final against Pakistan, he made a stunning comeback that is still remembered as one of the best in history. In recognition of his bravery, the Haryana government awarded him a cash prize of Rupees 21 lakhs and a position in the Haryana Police department. The position of Deputy Superintendent of Police is one of the most coveted in the police force.</p>
<p>Rahul, K.L. :</p>
<p>There are many who consider him to be one of the best right-handed batsmen of this generation. A place in the Indian cricket team is all but assured thanks to his spectacular hits. An Assistant Manager is a dream come true for many bankers because Assistant Managers are paid handsomely and enjoy near-eternal employment.</p>
<p>KL Rahul's dream job at the Reserve Bank of India can only be described as a dream come true because the competition for an RBI job is fierce. Additionally, RBI has its own rules and procedures for filling positions. However, a thorough IBPS PO Exam Analysis will show that you don't actually need to go through all that huff and puff if you want to get into a reputable bank because most of them now hire through the common IBPS exams.</p>
<p>Yuzvendra Chahal's name is:</p>
<p>When it comes to the limited-overs format, Yuzvendra Chahal, a talented spinner, has clearly emerged as Team India's top spinner. Because of his success in the Indian Premier League, he was invited to play for Team India. It's not an easy job to get, but the Income Tax Department rewarded him for his popularity and stellar on-field performances by giving him the position of Income Tax Officer. The SSC-CGL exams are notoriously difficult, and even the most dedicated aspirants have trouble passing them.</p>
<p>Sri Lankan cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni:</p>
<p>This is it: Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the crown jewel of cricketing royalty! He is the only captain in the history of cricket to win three world championships in all three formats, and is widely regarded as one of the most successful in India. He was awarded the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Indian Army for his outstanding contributions to Indian cricket. He may also be promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel after 13 years of service. For Mahi's second innings, we wish him well.</p>
