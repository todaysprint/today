<h1>How to Improve Your Calculation Speed in Any Competitive Exam </h1>


<div>
<p>Any competitive exam has a tough section called quantitative aptitude. Many students are afraid of this section, but if they plan ahead and practise hard, it has the potential to be the most difficult section on the exam.</p>
<p>The candidate, on the other hand, must have a solid grasp of the concepts, as well as a few core skills, one of which is speed.</p>
<p>In any competitive exam, a candidate with a high level of speed is more likely to perform well in the quantitative aptitude section.</p>
<p>A few tips and tricks on how to improve your calculation speed so as to maximise the number of attempts and thus the score on any competitive exam will be discussed here.</p>
<p>Practice<br />The more different kinds of sums a student does, the more likely he or she is to be able to solve complex problems, analyse them, and answer reasoning questions quickly and accurately. This is critical, especially in subjects like statistics, measurement, and quadratic equations, which often require extensive computations.</p>
<p>Methods of approximation<br />Long, difficult problems on quantitative ability are common in many competitive exams. Solving them requires a great deal of time and effort. As a result, no one will be able to stop students from improving their grades and passing their exams if they develop approximation strategies for faster calculations, increasing accuracy by nearly tenfold. Sets, Indices, and more can all benefit from this.</p>
<p>Conceptual Clarity<br />The first step is to make sure that the fundamentals and concepts are understood thoroughly. In arithmetic, this can speed up the process of getting a solution. Before learning a formula or short trick, make sure you understand the underlying principles so that if you ever forget it, you can quickly and easily derive it during the test.</p>
<p>Formulas and Quick Tips are essential to mastering the game.<br />Formulas and short tricks can be used whenever possible to solve arithmetical problems' sums. Thus, mastering various formulas and short tricks will aid in quickly solving long, complex questions.</p>
<p>Find out about Squares, Cubes, and Tables!<br />Learn the tables up to 25 and square and cubes up to 30 and 20 in order to speed up your computations. The higher the square or cube, the easier it is to solve. In addition, you should master short tricks for quick addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</p>
<p>They waste time on simple and quick computations because they can't remember. Additionally, you can brush up on your knowledge of the number system by studying the powers of two and three up to six.</p>
<p>Use the Reverse Solving Method.<br />Take a look at your options and pick the one that best fits the question and go for it when you're stumped on a question during an exam.</p>
<p>Perform mental arithmetic<br />We all know how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers. These calculations should be performed mentally rather than using traditional methods to answer Quantitative Aptitude/Numerical Ability questions. This can be done in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>Using Vedic Maths, one can perform Quantitative Aptitude calculations. Your time and effort will be saved by using Vedic Math Tricks to solve any JEE or ICSE/CBSE Math issue. Furthermore, Vedic Maths is a wonderful tool because it allows you to solve a problem simply by using it. Upper-level CBSE or ICSE Board students will encounter polynomial functions and quadratic sums; however, mastering Vedic Maths will help you succeed in these more challenging math topics as well.</p>
