<h1>Time Tested Preparation Tips to prepare for the State PSC & UPSC exams </h1>


<div>
<p>The Indian constitution mandates that state governments use a common selection process to hire qualified candidates. That's what the State Public Service Commission (State PSC) does. It assists the state government in recruiting, transferring, and disciplining staff members, among other things.</p>
<p>The union's Public Service Commission administers the prestigious IAS exam, widely regarded as one of the most difficult (UPSC). The United States Public Service Commission (UPSC) conducts nationwide recruitment processes to select candidates for various government positions. The State Public Service Commissions in each state also hold their own PSC Exam to select candidates for the various positions available in state government.</p>
<p>State PSC vs. UPSC:<br />The UPSC exams are noticeably more difficult than those given by the SAT or ACT. As an example, tens of thousands of people vie for just a few hundred spots in this year's UPSC Civil Services Exam (UPSC CSE). When compared to the UPSC exams, the state PSC exams are a little easier to pass. However, in the state PSC recruitment process, candidates from the home state are given the benefit of a large proportion of seats reserved for them, whereas there are no state-specific reservations or relaxations for UPSC candidates.</p>
<p>For state PSC exams, there is a significant delay between when the official notification is released and when the actual exam date is. This gives you more time to prepare for the exam and the subsequent stages.</p>
<p>Despite the differences, there is a striking resemblance in the application. an examination's scope and sequence, as well as its eligibility requirements. As a result, preparing for both the UPSC and a corresponding State PSC Exam at the same time is preferable to focusing solely on one of them.</p>
<p><br />Tips for preparing for the UPSC and State PSC examinations:</p>
<p>Nepotism and other issues are almost never brought up in connection with the state PSC exams. Delays and extensions are often the result of these factors. Stay on top of things and submit your application well in advance of the deadline. Kerala PSC recently announced a few vacancies, and it is recommended that you complete the Kerala PSC Application Process at least two weeks before the last date, if you are planning to sit for the exam.<br />Prepare for the exams with the help of the right tools. Start with the NCERT textbooks of class IV to class XI before diving into the most recommended or exam-specific Kerala PSC books, for example, if you are preparing for the recruitment of the Kerala PSC<br />The NCERT books will help you learn the basics, whereas the exam-specific books will give you more practise questions to work on your speed and accuracy.<br />Don't overlook the section on general awareness. Candidates often neglect the general knowledge section in favour of the quantitative aptitude, English language, and logical reasoning sections. They're under the impression that this can be handled quickly now that the deadline has passed. This, however, is not the case. It is possible for candidates to clear the overall cutoff with consistent effort in the general awareness section.<br />General awareness questions and final interviews will be based heavily on state issues and day-to-day affairs in order to select the best candidates for state PSC exams. As a result, it becomes imperative to read both the national and local newspapers.<br />When you're rehearsing questions, set a timer. After you've learned something new, practise applying what you've learned by answering practise questions about what you've learned.<br />Reading is a good habit to get into. In addition to helping you with current events questions, this practise will also help you improve your reading speed and English language skills.</p>
