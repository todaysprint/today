<h1>How to read effectively for exams, learning and fun! </h1>


<div>
<p>Any exam's preparation relies heavily on reading. Exams require students to understand the concepts they will be tested on. Reading comprehension-based questions are a major part of the IBPS, SBI PO,UPTET csir net syllabus, making it even more important!</p>
<p>Exam-specific study materials, such as IBPS, SBI, IAS, CSIR NET books, articles, blogs, and sheets, are often found in the study pool of a national or state-level aspirant.</p>
<p>As important as it is to pick the right books, it's even more crucial to read them correctly. Reading takes us into other realms as well, not just academics or preparation.</p>
<p>Here are a few pointers to help you get the most out of your reading time:</p>
<p>The first step is to train your brain to read in a specific way: in exam mode. Focus more on reading books and physical materials if your exam is offline. Doubts can be referred to the internet. Print out any notes or books you'll need from the internet and bring them with you. To prepare for an online exam, you can study the fundamentals by reading from a book, but you should make it a point to read online as much as possible in general. Use your laptop or desktop computer to read blogs and other material. You should not read on your phone.</p>
<p>Complete everything you start reading if you want to improve your reading skills and make it a regular habit to do so. Make a non-negotiable contract with yourself about this habit. You're a patient reader if you're in the habit of reading slowly. Whether it's a book, an article, or a concept, finish everything you start. Pass over nothing. Another benefit of this habit is that it helps you develop a better way of thinking about the world around you. You're more open to receiving information. Having this habit keeps you from getting distracted while reading a tedious reading comprehension passage during an exam. Candidates who lose interest in a passage are more likely to answer incorrectly. To overcome the RCs, cultivate this habit.</p>
<p>At least 45 minutes of uninterrupted reading is required: Increase your reading time. Do not fiddle with your phone or otherwise lose concentration while you're reading. Each time you sit down to read, spend about an hour doing so. You'll learn to read more patiently as a result of doing this. To begin, set an alarm on your phone to notify you when it's time to sit down and read. Make it a habit to start reading at the same time each day and time yourself with a stopwatch as you go. Don't stop reading after 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Take down the following information:</p>
<p>You should take small notes as you read.</p>
<p>In other words, it's like actively participating in the content you're reading and responding to it.</p>
<p>Because of this, it is more powerful. You'll retain the memory more deeply if you reread and reinterpret it. When you're reading the news, take notes. Organize current events into categories, such as national, sports, and so on. Frequently re-read and re-write what you've just read or written. Make a list of new words and their definitions when you're reading for the purpose of expanding your vocabulary in a newspaper or online. Always keep a pen in your hand while reading a book. Jot down your thoughts and questions on sticky notes or in a rough book. If you're a fan of academic reading, take the time to compile a list of key points. When reading a self-help guide or motivational book, write down your goals and plans that you believe will help you achieve them, and keep doing so. This will aid your recollection of what you've already read in the book.</p>
