<h1>Why Should Freshers Consider Government Jobs? </h1>

<p><strong>Why Is a Government Job a Good Choice for a Newcomer?</strong></p>
<p>When you think of a <strong>government office</strong>, you probably picture a place where there aren't a lot of kids or twenty-somethings working there. Since this is a long-standing myth, many young people avoid pursuing a career in the public sector upon graduation because of this perception.</p>
<p>However, the truth is quite different. In reality, government jobs are just as exciting, if not more exciting, than those in the private sector. Some of the best reasons to consider a career in government service will be discussed in this article.</p>
<p>#1 Wide Range of Possibilities and Ease of Use:<br />Government has created over 3 million jobs in the last four years alone (on average). The government's job market is always expanding. A decade ago, finding work in the public sector was much harder than it is today. From the comfort of one's own home, one can apply for a position of their choice. The application process for most government jobs is relatively simple. <strong>SSC (Staff Selection Commission)</strong>, UPSC (Union Public Service Commission), Railways (through the Railway Recruitment Board more popularly known as the RRB) and other government bodies regularly recruit for coveted positions.</p>
<p>Google "SSC CGL apply online" and soon enough you'll be on the SSC's website. SSC CGL application is just a few forms and a few clicks away.</p>
<p>Secondly, openness in the recruitment process and announcements to the general public:<br />When it comes to government jobs, every step of the hiring process is open to the public. You'll know exactly what you're getting yourself into. It is expected that the entire selection process, including exam dates, the number of vacancies that can be filled, eligibility requirements, and even the official answer key based on which exams are evaluated will be made available to the public online.</p>
<p>When applying for the SSC CGL, you would be aware of the exam pattern and number of open positions for each profile, as well as the tentative dates on which your SSC CGL admit card would be released, among other things. Everything is posted on their official website, and your local newspaper will have it as well.</p>
<p>Additionally, you don't have to be concerned about being ghosted by the HR team or getting no response from the recruiters even after several rounds of interviews and follow-ups. We're not lying when we say that up to 60% of job applications in the private sector go unanswered.</p>
<p>#3 Moving isn't a big deal:<br />This may be the most overlooked factor. You may not have to give up your papers if you move within the United States or your state. Requesting a transfer to a different location within the same company is an option. Generally speaking, these kinds of requests are met. In the private sector, this would not be the case.</p>
<p># 4 Preparation and Access to Readings.<br />You can find a plethora of free online resources, such as mock tests and YouTube videos. You can also find live classes and expert articles. Additionally, students can get their hands on previous years' exam papers and cutoff scores without difficulty. Most government exams have a nearly identical syllabus and exam pattern. As a result, you'll be able to sit for more than one exam.</p>
<p>Holidays and vacations are number five on our list.<br />Jobs in the public sector tend to be more hospitable to workers. For the most part, you won't be summoned to work on an important presentation over the weekend, nor will you be summoned for meetings on a public holiday. Because most government jobs are 9-5 jobs and paid leave policies are less strict than the standard 12 days of vacation per year in the private sector, the work-life balance is unmatched.</p>
<p>Sixth, job and financial security.<br />Having a government job provides the most obvious advantage. Because of the adequate pension, you won't have to worry about your financial security after you retire. During your time in the public sector, you will also be eligible for a wide range of benefits that the private sector may not be able to provide.</p>
<p>We hope that this article has convinced you to consider a career in the public sector.</p>
<p>When it comes to applying for a government job, it's time to put your doubts aside and start filling out the application.<br />Good luck with your job search!</p>
