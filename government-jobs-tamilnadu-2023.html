<h1>MAJOR TRENDS IN CURRENT EDUCATION SYSTEM </h1>


<div>
<p>Throughout history, the Indian Industrial Organization has been a group of workers from a variety of backgrounds working together. Organizations today are more integrated and interconnected than they were in the past, resulting in the need for employees to perform additional duties outside of their primary roles. For instance, an engineer's role in an organisation is evolving rapidly over time, and he may be required to participate or contribute in such a managerial role. In today's education system, a Master's degree is promoted more than ever before because it is not incorrect to say that the education system has a responsibility to prepare any employee to face such situations. Students in Andhra Pradesh can now apply for master's degree programmes at some of India's best colleges and universities through an exam called the Andhra Pradesh Common Entrance Test (AP ICET), which serves as an action plan for making the idea of this plan a reality.</p>
<p><br />There has been an upward trend in technical education over the last two decades, but in the last few years, the demand for master's degrees has also increased rapidly, particularly for MBAs and MCAs (Master of Fine Arts) and other related degrees (Master of Computer Application). For the sake of ensuring that no student in the state of Andhra Pradesh is left behind in education, the Andhra Pradesh government has decided to conduct a state-level exam that will allow students to apply for admission to master's degree programmes in MCA and MBA at the state universities and their affiliated colleges on merit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is administered by the Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education (AP SCHE) on behalf of Sri Venkateswara University Tirupati, which falls under the authority of the AP SCHE. Applicants must pay 550/- as an application fee and wait for the results to be announced on May 6th to fill out the application form released on March 3rd via online mode for the year 2020's exam. The exam is scheduled to take place on April 27th. Nevertheless, these dates may be extended due to the COVID19 outbreak in India's lockdown. The duration of this exam is two and a half hours, with 200 objective-based questions being asked during that time. As for the admissions criteria, students must have a bachelor's degree or an equivalent degree with at least 50 percent marks for General/OBC and 45 percent marks for reserved categories.</p>
<p>It was established as India's 29th state after secession from Andhra Pradesh's northwestern region in the name of the united progressive alliance, sparked by the Telangana movement. They needed to set up a state-level education system after the new state was created, so they largely followed the structure of the Andhra Pradesh education system. To stay on par with the rest of the country, they followed suit and implemented the TSICET (Telangana State Integrated Common Entrance Test) for admission to MBA and MCA programmes at state-affiliated universities and institutions of higher learning. TSCHE (Telangana State Council of Higher Education) relies on Kakatiya University, Warangal to administer the exam each year to ensure that students are admitted solely on the basis of merit.</p>
<p><br />In order to apply to 273 colleges in the state of Telangana, candidates must pay an application fee of 650/- for the general/OBC category and 450/- for the SC/ST, according to the official website. The exam will be held online at 14 locations on May 20 and 21, with a 150-minute exam time. However, due to the lockdown in India, the dates may be extended further. TSICET has the same requirements for admission as the AP entrance exam.</p>
