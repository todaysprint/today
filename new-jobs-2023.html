<h1>Magic of Social Media in Education </h1>


<div>
<p>When someone mentions social media, what comes to mind first? Entertainment? Entertainment is unquestionably a major motivator for the billions of people who use social media every day. I'm here to tell you that social media can do a lot more than just that.</p>
<p>Use social media to find the Facebook page or profile's contact information or to get driving directions to your favourite restaurant. A reliable source for business information and contact information is available through this platform.</p>
<p>You may have seen a slideshow of your favourite clothing, jewellery, shoes, or other items that you recently purchased on an E-commerce site while you were reading this information on Facebook or Instagram. I'm referring to Social Media Ads at this point.</p>
<p>WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Instagram Stories, or Snapchat commenting, how often do you communicate with your friends? Surely, it's almost every day, right? That Social Media is a communication medium is implied by this statement.</p>
<p>The latest news may be a trending topic on Twitter when you open your Twitter account on your mobile device. As a result, news can be found on social media.</p>
<p>There is a good chance that you are a teacher or a student who has joined a number of educational Facebook groups. As a result, you may receive notifications about educational events.</p>
<p>Visiting a store to find out more about a product or service or to see advertisements or read the newspaper is a thing of the past thanks to social media.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at how social media is changing education.</p>
<p>The development of the Flipped Classroom Model<br />The field of Education in Social media is given paramount importance in today's era, in addition to those previously mentioned (news sources, entertainment, contact information, etc.). Students, teachers, and technology are all connected through social media. New LMS (Learning Management Systems) like Blackboard, Moodle, and WebCT have made it possible for professors to easily integrate their courses with social media. As a result, the flipped classroom model has emerged, in which students watch lectures online, participate in class discussions, and complete homework under the supervision of mentors.</p>
<p>School/University Students' Use of Social Media<br />Students and faculty at some institutions produce their own podcasts and video blogs. Social media is used to spread the word about these podcasts. University Facebook pages allow them to make announcements about fees, courses, and other issues. On the page, they also post events, which are sent out to a wide audience in order to publicise them and track attendance.</p>
<p>Blogs are an essential study aid.<br />A blog is used by universities and schools to make important announcements and announcements. Useful study materials, which can be shared on various social media channels, can also be shared via these devices.</p>
<p>Contact Professionals You Can Trust<br />You can learn a lot about a particular field's experts thanks to social media. After following these experts, you'll be able to benefit from their knowledge. In time, you begin to absorb the valuable information from these experts, which proves to be a valuable learning experience. Furthermore, you can speak with these professionals directly and get your questions answered rather than just passively learning from them.</p>
<p>A Root for a Sedentary Career<br />You could be a college professor, a high school teacher, or a tutor. An urge to start a passive career as an online coach or tutor can be sparked by sites like Vimeo or YouTube.</p>
<p>A digital portfolio of your work is all you'll need. If you correctly promote your digital portfolio on social media, you will always be one step ahead of the competition.<br />Although social media has many benefits for education, it also has some drawbacks.</p>
<p>This is what you'll find:</p>
<p>The information you find on social media isn't always reliable.<br />Your Facebook Newsfeed or any other social media platform may contain any piece of information you're looking for. However, not all of it can be relied upon. Social media is a popular way for students to stay up to date on important announcements and notifications from their schools. Re-check the information and then pass it on to someone else.</p>
<p>Inappropriate use of social networking sites<br />Students who spend too much time on social media often find that their grades suffer as a result. Checking notifications on social media all the time can be a distraction while you're trying to concentrate on your studies.</p>
<p>Face-to-face communication is on the decline.<br />It has been found that those who spend a lot of time on social media tend to have less time for face-to-face interaction.</p>
