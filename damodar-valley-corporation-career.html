Those who intend to sit for the next MTS Exam should devise a study plan that will help them pass the test on their first attempt. More than a million people apply for the position each year, but many of them fail because to a lack of preparation and a high level of competition. Candidates should review the SSC MTS Syllabus before making any final decisions about their strategy so that they are well-prepared for the test. a computer-based test (Paper-I) and a descriptive essay form the MTS examination (Paper-I). Candidates should plan beforehand for the next exam in order to succeed in both rounds of the selection process.

<p>Inquisitiveness and Critical Thinking<br />These tests measure a candidate's ability to deal with abstract concepts and symbols and their relationships, as well as analytical functions and arithmetical computation. Candidates are recommended to practise more and more problems from the General Intelligence and Reasoning segment in order to recognise the underlying trend. Also, if a question takes a long time to answer, they should go on to the next one and return to the lengthy one later if time permits. Nonverbal types are included in this section. In this section, we'll cover such critical issues as:</p>
<p>Differences and similarities<br />Visualization of Space<br />Problem-solving \sAnalysis<br />Visual Memory, Discriminative Observation, and Decision-Making<br />Concepts of Relationship<br />A System for Sorting Pictures<br />Series of Arithmetic Numbers<br />Nonverbal series, for example.<br />The English language<br />The higher the candidates' language and grammar skills are, the more likely they are to do well here. To improve their vocabulary, applicants can turn to resources such as Norman Lewis' Word Power Made Easy.. They should read newspapers and books on a daily basis to learn new words and phrases and focus on applying those newly learnt words to boost their skills. Among the things covered here: vocabulary, grammar, and usage<br />Structure of a sentence.<br />Synonyms and antonyms<br />Correction of a Mistake.<br />Word for Word Substitution, etc.<br />Abilities with numbers<br />The questions in the Numerical Aptitude area of the SSC MTS Exam are easier than those in the other sections.
