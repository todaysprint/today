<h1>How to Prepare Reasoning for IBPS SO Prelims Examination? </h1>


<div>
<p>IBPS SO Examination, though the general competition of banking exams is eliminated due to the need for holding special qualifications for the SO posts, the competition remains tough due to limited vacancies. IBPS PO vacancies are typically released every year in the range of 1500-1800. To compete for the few openings, about 2-3 lakh aspirants submit their ibps scores online.</p>
<p>Because of the large number of applicants, the IBPS SO prelims examination must eliminate the maximum number of candidates. Because of this, the IBPS SO preliminary examination is often difficult to pass. It's impossible to pass the prelims without a strong performance in Reasoning, which is a major component of all IBPS SO posts. As a result, we'll go over some of the best strategies for performing well on the Specialist officer reasoning test in this article.</p>
<p>How to ace the IBPS SO reasoning section in no time with these pro tips<br />What you need to know: Most IBPS SO candidates are not part of the general competition, so they are not familiar with the IBPS Reasoning sections' requirements and needs. Knowing the syllabus and exam level of IBPS SO is the first step in gaining mastery over Reasoning Section. Before moving on to the more difficult topics, you must first master the simpler ones. This necessitates a high degree of awareness.<br />One of the simplest topics in IBPS SO Reasoning is inequality. You'll be able to master this subject in no more than a couple of days. Inequality questions make up about 5 percent of the bank exam's total marks. Despite the fact that inequality is a relatively simple concept, you'll need to practise it until you can solve inequality questions in less than 20-30 seconds.<br />For those who haven't studied for a competitive exam, syllogism is an easy topic that can be covered in 3-5 days with some practise. If you're going to attempt to pass the IBPS SO exam, you'll need to have a solid grasp of syllogism fundamentals. Furthermore, your primary goal should be to achieve high speed and accuracy in all other types of questions, such as syllogisms.<br />After Inequality and syllogism, blood relation is a good topic to study to improve your score. " Practicality trumps theoretical understanding in the area of blood relations. There are usually a few high-scoring questions in this section.<br />Before moving on to reasoning questions, you'll need to know the basics of directions and distance. It's time to move on to the next easy-to-understand topic, which is Direction &amp; Distance. This is a simple topic, and all you need to do is practise so that you can answer these questions in the shortest amount of time possible.<br />There are 10-15 marks to be earned by answering random questions, but you'll never get a good score unless you know how to solve puzzles and figure out where people should sit in the room. Since solving puzzles and figuring out seating arrangements for the IBPS SO Exam will take a lot of practise and time, you may want to start with the easier topics. Questions about Seating Arrangement and Puzzles are difficult to master without a lot of practise, so you should attempt to solve at least 10-12 puzzles in your first few days of studying. Regular quizzes, mini mock tests, and mock tests can help students become better at solving puzzles.<br />Alphanumeric series and coding-decoding &amp; Input-Output are just two examples of other miscellaneous questions that may be asked. These questions are not guaranteed to appear in every shift of the IBPS SO exam, but at least a few of them will. Preparation is key, so do your part now.</p>
