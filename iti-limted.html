<h1>UPSC CDS 2023: Ultimate Guide to the Recruitment Process </h1>


<div>
<p>Candidates for the Indian Navy, Indian Army, and Indian Air Force are selected through the Combined Defence Services Examination (CDS) conducted by the Union Public Service Commission. The CDS exam draws more than a million applicants, yet the SSB interview only attracts a fraction of that number. There are numerous employment options and a lucrative UPSC CDS Salary Package available after passing the Combined Defence Services Examination. The candidate's performance in the Written Exam and SSB Interview are used to determine their eligibility. Because the UPSC CDS exam isn't a walk in the park, it's necessary for candidates to know every step of the recruiting procedure before applying for this next exam. Consequently, we have compiled this article with a detailed guide to the UPSC CDS Recruitment Process in order to assist all CDS hopefuls before the examination.</p>
<p>One of the most crucial factors to consider while applying for any exam is determining eligibility criteria. Candidates must meet all of the UPSC CDS Eligibility Criteria requirements before they can apply for the exam. Age, educational attainment, and physical fitness are all taken into consideration while assessing CDA eligibility. Candidates must be between the ages of 18 and 23 and have graduated from a recognised university with a degree in the necessary discipline. Finally, in order to be considered for the exam, each applicant must meet the minimum physical requirements.</p>
<p>Process of Making a Request<br />The UPSC CDS Application Form must be completed by all qualified and interested candidates as soon as it is made accessible on the official website. Filling out both portions of the application form is required in order to continue forward in the application process. Then, either pay the application fee online or by mail, depending on your preference. SC, ST, and Female candidates are exempt from the application cost, while those from the general and OBC categories must pay Rs 200.</p>
<p>An Admit Card will be given in a few weeks for all enrolled candidates who have properly submitted their application form. They can use their Roll Number or Registration Number to view their admit card on the official website. Admit cards will not be sent to applicants by postal service or courier in hard copy form. In addition, you must bring your CDS Admit Card to the examination room.</p>
<p>Taking the Test<br />Candidates must show up for the written exam on the specified date after downloading their admission cards. English, General Knowledge, and Elementary Math are the three portions of the CDS Exam Pattern for the written exam for INA, Air Force, and the IMA respectively. This section is worth a total of 300 points. Officers Training Academy's written test consists of two parts: English and General Knowledge. This section's final grade will be 200 points. In order to be eligible for the SSB interview, candidates must pass the written exam first.</p>
<p>SSB Examination<br />To qualify for the SSB Interview phase, candidates must have passed the written exam. The purpose of the interview is to gauge a candidate's level of mental preparedness, self-assurance, and wits. In order to proceed to the second step of the interview round, candidates must first qualify in the SSB Interview Round, which has two phases.</p>
<p>The Ending<br />Candidates are selected based on their performance in the Written Exam and SSB Interview Round. In order to be considered for training, candidates must work hard and achieve minimal qualifying marks in both rounds. After the announcement of the final results, the selected candidates must attend training at the Air Force Academy, Indian Military Academy, Officer Training Academy, and Indian Naval Academy.</p>
